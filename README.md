# MastermindProgram
Code to play and solve the code breaking game Mastermind. Traditional Mastermind is a code of length 4 chosen from 6 different colors, I've added functionality to change these parameters.

Have 4 main algorithms coded
1. Random Guess
2. MaxParts (Kooi, 2005)
3. AverageElim which I developed independently then realized it's the same as (Irving, 1979)
4. MaxEntropy (Bestavros and Belal, 1986)
5. MiniMax (Knuth, 1976). There is a tiny difference in performance that I cannot pin down. Comparing with the listed stats in the paper below

More information on these algorithms can be found here

NOTES:
This is only my second project in Python so I am aware that many things could have been done better. My variable naming is especially poor but I may go back and fix it once I get the chance.
Coded and ran all this code in Python using Spyder IDE.
